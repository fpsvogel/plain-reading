\ Welcome! This is a template for your own plain-text reading list.
\ This file can be turned into a pretty webpage at Plain Reading (https://plainreading.com): just register for an account, then upload your reading.csv file, or connect to your Dropbox where you have it saved.

\ Any line in this file starting with a backslash (\) is a comment and will be ignored by Plain Reading.
\ Feel free to delete these explanatory comments once you don't need to refer back to them anymore.

\ You can edit this file in any spreadsheet app or text editor. When you open the file, be sure to select the pipe character (|) as the column separator.

\   🙥 THE BASICS 🙦
\ ╘══════════════════╛

\ Now let's take a look at how your reading.csv should be formatted. Here is the beginning of a minimal reading list:



\Author - Title|Dates finished
\------ IN PROGRESS
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
Tom Holt - Goatsong: A Novel of Ancient Athens -- The Walled Orchard, #1|2019/06/18, 2020/5/8

\ Columns are divided by a pipe character (|).
\ This means you *must not* use the pipe character anywhere except to divide columns.
\ At the top we have the column headers.
\ Next is a section header. "In progress" means items that you're currently reading, watching, etc.
\ Notice that these headers (the first two lines) are comments. They are for your convenience and don't need to be formatted in any particular way.

\ Then we have two items, books in this case.
\ As you can see, the author is optional. The first item omits it.
\ You're currently re-reading the second item: it has two "Dates finished", making this your third time reading it. Nice!
\ Dates can have leading zeroes ("06" in "2019/06/18") or omit them ("2020/5/8"), whichever you prefer.
\ Dates must be in order. By default the direction is left-to-right (earlier dates on the left), but you can switch the direction in Plain Reading's Settings.

\ If this minimal kind of reading list is what you want, just be sure to go to the Settings page in Plain Reading and disable the columns that you don't want to use, so that your reading.csv can be properly parsed and turned into a pretty webpage.
\ You could go even more minimalist and disable the Dates Finished column if you just want to keep a list of titles of books you've read.

\ But by default, all columns are enabled. Here are those same two items, but now with all columns:



\Rating|Format, Author, Title|Sources, ISBN/ASIN|Dates added > Started, Progress|Dates finished|Genres|Length|Public notes|Blurb|Private notes|History

\ Wow. That's a lot. But again, you can go to Settings and disable the columns that you don't want.
\ And even when they are all enabled, you don't *have* to fill in every column every time. For example, the first item above omits the first column and the last two columns. The second item also omits the last few columns, except for History. (It seems you were inspired to carefully track of your re-reading of the book in 2020.) See the Appendix at the bottom for details on History.
\ The title is the only piece of information that's required on every line. Everything else is optional.

\ On the Settings page in Plain Reading, you can also hide individual pieces of information, if you want to have them in your reading.csv but not in your pretty webpage.
\ Many other things are customizable in Settings, such as the rating scale (1-5, 1-10, etc.) and the formats and their emojis.

\ Here are a few more examples.
\ If at any point you wonder, "Why do I have to do it exactly this way, when Plain Reading doesn't even show all this information in My List?" the answer is that this information *is* being parsed and saved by Plain Reading, and will play a part in upcoming features such as a Statistics page.
\ This time, let's list items that you've finished.

So fun that after listening to the audiobook, I immediately proceeded to read the book, for its illustrations. If I'd read this as a kid, I might have been inspired to become a scientist.

\ "Robert Louis…":  The series ("Mount Hope Classics") comes after a special word: "in" (must be lowercase).
    \ Extra info can also be indicated after the title: in this example, the translator and the fact that this book is unabridged.
    \ The series and extra info can appear in any order. This could have been "… Thesauraria -- unabridged - in Mount Hope Classics - trans. Arcadius Avellanus".
    \ Two hyphens surrounded by a space (" -- ") are the divider before series, before extra info, between notes, and (as we'll see in the last example of this section) between item variants.
    \ Also, you can include the group experience emoji (🤝🏼) after a date started. If you write a note after the emoji, it will be shown in your public notes by default. In Plain Reading's Settings you can choose not to show group experiences.
\ "Total Cat Mojo": DNF means "Did Not Finish". You can specify your stopping point with a percentage, a length such as "55p" or "1:03". Or you can not specify it at all, as in the next example. If you don't specify the stopping point or if the stopping point was the same each time you read it, you can just write "DNF" once before the format and title, like this:
    2|DNF 50% 🔊Total Cat Mojo|…
    \ Also in this example we have "for friends" in the Genres column. This makes the item visible only to your friends on Plain Reading. (Maybe you don't want the whole world to know that you listened to a cat audiobook… twice.) The other visibility levels are "for starred friends" (or "for starred") and "for me" (or "private" if you prefer). Or you can use "to" instead of "for", and/or hyphens instead of spaces, e.g. "to me", "to-me", or "for-me". Besides these per-item visibility markers, you'll find lots of global visibility options in Settings.
\ "FiveThirtyEight…": Here we see a multi-item line. This is most useful when you DNF'ed several items and equally disliked them. But a multi-item line doesn't *have* to be DNF.
\ "Randall…": This is an item that you re-read as a different *variant*: in this example, the first variant is an audiobook from Lexpub, and the second variant is an ebook from Amazon.
    \ - In the Sources column you can describe each variant with these data, in this order: format, source(s), ISBN/ASIN, length, and/or extra info. These are all formatted in the same way as usual.
    \ - If a variant omits data that can also be in other columns (format, length, extra info), then this data in the variant will be defined by other columns rather than being blank. So if these data are the same across all variants, you can write them down just once in the other columns.
    \ - The exception is progress (without "DNF") before the title, which only applies to the most recent date. See the second In Progress example earlier: the "50%" before the title describes the current re-reading of the book, not the previous readings.
    \ - Variants can be separated either by format emojis or (if you omit the emojis) by a double hyphen with a space around it (" -- "). But if you have any extra info in Sources, that divider is already being used there, so in that case you *must* include format emojis even if all the variants have the same format.
    \ - If you include any format emojis in Sources, then you have to include them for every variant. But the other data can be specified in some variants and not in others.
    \ - Now let's look at the Date Started column. After each date started you can specify the variant to which it refers with "v" followed by a number, such as "v2" for the second variant, "v3" for the third, and so on.
    \ - A date started with no variant specified refers to the first variant. In this example, you listened to the audiobook in the first half of August, then you read the ebook in the second half of August, and then in September you listened to the audiobook again.



\ Whew! That covers all the odd cases that Plain Reading handles, except for the History column, which I've relegated to the Appendix at the bottom since not everyone is so… *careful* as to want to track every page of every day.
\ I'm open to new ideas, so if you want to add an item in your reading.csv in a different way that Plain Reading *can't* handle currently, then please let me know by adding a feature request at https://github.com/fpsvogel/plain-reading/issues

\  ☙ jotting down planned items ❧
\ ╘════════════════════════════════╛

\ There's one last thing left: planned items, your "to read" list. One way to track this is to have normal items, but without a date started, and (if you want) with a date added, which is marked by a semicolon after it.

 |📕Randall Munroe - How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems|Lexpub B07NCQTJV3|2021/06/27 >| |science|320

\ But this method has two disadvantages for listing books that you just *might* read: (a) it takes more time than just jotting down the title, and (b) it takes up a lot of space if you have a long "to read" list.
\ Here is a quicker and more compact way to jot down planned items:

\HISTORICAL FICTION: ⚡Tom Holt - A Song for Nero, 🔊True Grit @Little Library, @Hoopla, 🔊Two Gentlemen of Lebowski @Lexpub
\SCIENCE: 📕Randall Munroe - How To: Absurd Scientific Advice for Common Real-World Problems @Lexpub, 🔊On the Origin of Species, 🔊Weird Earth @Hoopla

\ For Plain Reading to parse planned these compact planned items, you must:
    \ - Include the format emoji before each title.
    \ - Start the line with a comment character, then a single genre in all caps, then a colon (:).
\ The all-caps genre is changed to lowercase in Plain Reading. So if you have a "science" genre, the items after "SCIENCE" here will be in that same "science" genre.
\ At the end of an item you can list sources, each immediately preceded by "@".

\ By default, planned items are visible only to friends.
\ To change this and other settings, and to discover even more features not covered here, see the Settings page: https://plainreading.com/settings

\ The History column is handy if you want to track your reading/watching/listening in detail.
\ In the future, Plain Reading will have a Statistics page where you can see charts about your reading habits. For Plain Reading to understand your reading histories, they must be written in a particular way. Here are some examples:

\ "Eyes on the Prize": You can use a URL as a source, and you can list multiple sources.
    \ This is is also an example of more detailed tracking with the History column, a comma-separated list of dates when you made progress on an item.
    \ - Only the first date needs to be written out in full.
    \ - The length of your progress should appear after the date: in this case, one hour on the 28th of July.
    \ - Length can be omitted wherever it is the same as the one last indicated. All of the episodes in this series are one hour long, so in this case the "1:00" after the other dates would be unnecessary, and so it's omitted.
    \ - "x5" and "x4" mean "five times" and "four times": on the 31st you watched five episodes, and on the 1st you watched four episodes. Then on the 2nd and 3rd you went back to watching just one episode per day as before. (You could also do "7/31 5:00, 8/1 4:00, 8/2 1:00, 8/3" and that means the same thing.)
    \ - Use " -- " to start a new perusal (re-watching). (Since you're currently re-watching this, it would make sense to move it up to your "In progress" section, but you don't *have* to.)
    \ - This example means, in plain English: "On the 28th of July, 2021, I watched for an hour. I did the same on the 29th and 30th. Then over the weekend I went on a bender and watched 5 hours on the 31st and four hours on the 1st of Autust. I finished up the series by watching an hour on the 2nd and another hour on the 3rd. But I enjoyed the series so much that I started it over in September, watching an hour on the 1st and another hour on the 2nd."

\ "Escriba Café": Here's a more complex History, where you're listening to a podcast with irregular episode lengths.
    \ - In this case you left the Dates Started, Dates Finished, and Length columns empty because you think you'll keep listening to a new episode once in a while. There is no definite state of being "in progress" or "done" with this podcast, and therefore no definite total length either.
    \ - So this way, the total length is the sum of what you've written in History, the date started is the first date in History, and the date finished is the last date in History. Technically this means the item is always in a "finished" state, so it's best for items that you consume sporadically.
    \ - You can add extra text after the date, such as (in this example) "Bella Luna" to indicate the title of the first episode. This extra text can appear either before or after the length.
    \ - This example means, in plain English: "On the 12th of July, 2021, I listened to the episode Bella Luna, which was twenty minutes long. Then on the 13th I listened to another episode of the same length. Then on the same day I listened to a 45-minute episode. On the 17th I listened to a half-hour episode, then from the 18th through the 21st I listened to one episode per day, each of them half an hour long. On the 1st of August, I listened to another half-hour episode called As sete Maravilhas."
    \ - If you wanted to track this History more simply, you could just write an average episode length after the first date, so this example would look like this: "2021/07/12 0:30, 7/13 x2, 7/17, 7/18-21, 8/1". You could even omit the months wherever unnecessary: "2021/07/12 0:30, 13 x2, 17, 18-21, 8/1".

\ Let's go back to our novel Goatsong, way above in the "In progress" examples, to take another look at its History column:
    5|50% 📕Tom Holt - Goatsong: A Novel of Ancient Athens -- The Walled Orchard, #1|0312038380|2019/05/28, 2020/05/01, 2021/08/17|2019/06/13, 2020/05/23|novel,history|247||||2019/5/1 p31, 5/2 p54, 5/6-15 10p, 5/20 p200, 5/21 done

    \ Here's what we can learn from this example:
    \ - Length can be in pages, such as "5/1 p31" meaning "on 5/1 I read 31 pages".
    \ - But in this example we see "5/1 p31", with the "p" before the number. This means "on 5/1 I read up until page 31". This is useful for longer items like books and audiobooks, where it's easier to see your stopping point than to calculate how much you read or listened to in a day.
    \ - To do the same with times, use a leading hyphen: "5/1 -4:00" means "On the 1st of May I listened/watched up to the 4-hour mark."
    \ - "5/23 done" is shorthand for the last page, "5/23 p247".
    \ - This example means, in plain English: "On the 1st of March, 2019, I read up to page 31. On the 2nd I read up to page 54. From the 6th through the 15th I read 10 pages per day. Then on the 20th, I read up to page 200, and on the 21st I finished the book."
