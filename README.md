## Rationale: Why am I building this?

Because I love reading and keeping track of my reading, but I don't love the limitations of Goodreads and other social reading sites. In particular:

- I don't like going into a site or app every time I want to make a small change such as adding a reading note. I find it much faster to edit a plain text file which I always have open on my computer.
- I don't like being limited to a library of existing book metadata. In Goodreads I could add new titles to their library, but that is cumbersome. Plus, it's nice to be able to track items other than books.
- On Goodreads and similar sites, my reading data is theirs, not mine. I could get my data by exporting it as a CSV file, but then the formatting of the file is terrible because it's full of junk columns that I don't want.

These considerations led me to start tracking my reading and notes directly in a CSV file. Then a problem arose: how to share my reading list with friends? I'm sure they wouldn't want to wade through my massive CSV file, and anyway I have some items and notes in there that I don't want everyone to see.

That's where Plain Reading helps: it transforms your `reading.csv` into a page that you can share with friends or the world.

Plain Reading is customizable in what data you want to include in your `reading.csv`. For more on the reading list format, see [the guide at Plain Reading](https://plainreading.herokuapp.com/guide).

## Requirements

- Ruby 3+
- Node.js 14+
- PostgreSQL 9.3+

## Initial setup

- Checkout the plainreading git tree from Github:
    ```sh
    $ git clone git://github.com/fpsvogel/plainreading.git
    $ cd plainreading
    plainreading$
    ```
- Run Bundler to install gems needed by the project:
    ```sh
    plainreading$ bundle
    ```
- Log in to PostgreSQL and create a user:
    ```
    $ psql -U postgres
    postgres=# create role "your_username" login createdb
    postgres=# exit
    ```
- Create the development and test databases:
    ```sh
    plainreading$ rails db:create
    ```
  - If you see an error about peer authentication, then you need to [change one or two settings in pg_hba.conf](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-trying-to-ge), then try creating the databases again.
- Load the schema into the new database:
    ```sh
    plainreading$ rails db:schema:load
    ```
- Seed the database:
    ```sh
    plainreading$ rails db:seed
    ```
